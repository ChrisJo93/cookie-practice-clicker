# Express/Passport with React
This version uses React to control the login requests and redirection in coordination with client-side routing.

## Create database and table

Create a new database called `prime_app` and create a `person` table:

```SQL
CREATE TABLE person (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    username VARCHAR (80) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    password VARCHAR (1000) NOT NULL
);
```

## Development Setup Instructions
* Run `npm install`,
* Start postgres if not running already by using `brew services start postgresql`
* Run `npm run start:server` in an open tab of terminal to start the server
* Run `npm run start` in an open tab of terminal to start the web site

## Production Build:
* Start postgres if not running already by using `brew services start postgresql`
* Run `npm run build` in an open tab of terminal to build the react application to `/build`
* Run `npm run start:server` to start the server
* Navigate to `localhost:5000` to view the site


### Lay of the Land
* `src/` contains the React application
* `server/` contains the Express App
* `public/` contains static assets for the client-side
